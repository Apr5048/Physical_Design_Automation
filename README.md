P&R Tool-
Use Synopsys IC Compiler to complete the P&R (Place and Route) flow for a given synthesizedstandard-cell design while minimizing core area and clock.
Two-way Min-cut Partitioning-
Implement Fiducciaâ€“Mattheyses algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning whileminimizing the cut size under balance constraint.
Fixed-outline Floorplan Design-
Implement B* Tree algorithm to solve the fixed-outline floorplan design with a set of hard blockswhile minimizing the total wirelength.
Global Routing-
Implement an existing algorithm to solve the global routing problem with a set of 2-pin nets whileminimizing the total wirelength
