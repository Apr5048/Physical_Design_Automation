## Notice 
If you want to run it, please read README in src/.

## Homework2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Implement Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## Homework3: Fixed-outline Floorplan Design
Implement B* Tree algorithm to solve the fixed-outline floorplan design with a set of hard blocks while minimizing the total wirelength.

## Homework4: Placement Legalization
Implement an existing algorithm, called “Abacus”, to legalize a given global placement result with minimal displacement.

## Homework5: Global Routing
Implement an existing algorithm to solve the global routing problem with a set of 2-pin nets while minimizing the total wirelength.
