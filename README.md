## Homework2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Implement Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## Homework3: Fixed-outline Floorplan Design
Implement B* Tree algorithm to solve the fixed-outline floorplan design with a set of hard blocks while minimizing the total wirelength.

## Homework5: Global Routing
Implement an existing algorithm to solve the global routing problem with a set of 2-pin nets while minimizing the total wirelength.
